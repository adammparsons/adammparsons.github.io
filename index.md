## Who am I

I am a Staffordshire University student whose passion for games has led me to taking a computing GCSE course, a course on Games Development and now a Bachelor of Science, BSc (Hons) for Computer Games Programming.

I have completed work experience in a graphic design business, and gained valuable skills such as coding in languages such as C++ and the understanding of commercial games engines such as Unreal Engine 4 and Gamemaker Studio.
