My passion for games has led me to taking a computing GCSE course and a course on Games Development. I have completed work experience in a graphic design business, and gained valuable skills such as utilising Adobe Photoshop.

I am currently studying Computer Games Programming at Staffordshire University, and aspire to program games as a career.
